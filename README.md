# Schwarzschild Light-Bending Explorer üï≥Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüí°
Interactive Dash application that **numerically integrates null geodesics in the Schwarzschild metric** and lets you

* watch photon trajectories curve (or plunge) around a non-rotating black hole;  
* compare the exact numerical deflection angle with the theoretical weak-field formula  

Developed for a Computer Simulation classes and documented in the accompanying report (`report.pdf`).
