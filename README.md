# Schwarzschild Light-Bending Explorer üï≥Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüí°
Interactive Dash applications that **numerically integrate null geodesics in the Schwarzschild metric**. Two complementary dashboards let you

* watch photon trajectories curve (or plunge) around a non-rotating black hole;  
* compare the exact numerical deflection angle with the theoretical weak-field formula  

**2D Dashboard:** Classic top‚Äëdown view; photon paths bend in the  plane & compare to the weak‚Äëfield formula.

**3D Dashboard:** Full three‚Äëdimensional visualisation; light‚Äëray planes can be tilted by an inclination slider so you can orbit the scene and appreciate genuine spatial curvature.

Developed for a Computer Simulation classes and documented in the accompanying report (`report.pdf`).
